# Requirements Consolidation Summary

## 📁 **Changes Made:**

### ✅ **1. Removed `requirements-scripts.txt`**
- **File deleted** from project root
- **Reason**: Dependencies merged into unified build requirements system

### ✅ **2. Updated `build/requirements/base.txt`**
- **Added**: `python-dateutil>=2.8.0` to Utilities section
- **Reason**: Required by API clients for date/time parsing operations

### ✅ **3. Updated Documentation**
- **scripts/clients/README.md**: Updated installation instructions to reference `build/requirements/base.txt`

## 🔧 **Dependency Mapping:**

### **Previously in requirements-scripts.txt:**
```
requests>=2.28.0          → Already covered in base.txt (2.31.0)
python-dateutil>=2.8.0    → Added to base.txt
dataclasses>=0.6          → Not needed (Python 3.7+ built-in)
```

### **Now in build/requirements/base.txt:**
```python
# Utilities
requests==2.31.0
click==8.1.7
python-dateutil>=2.8.0    # NEW: For API clients and date/time parsing
```

## 🚀 **Updated Installation Process:**

### **For Development:**
```bash
pip install -r build/requirements/dev.txt
```

### **For UAT:**
```bash
pip install -r build/requirements/uat.txt
```

### **For Production:**
```bash
pip install -r build/requirements/prod.txt
```

All environments now include the necessary dependencies for API clients since they inherit from `base.txt`.

## ✅ **Benefits Achieved:**

1. **Unified Dependency Management**: Single source of truth for all Python dependencies
2. **Environment Consistency**: All environments (dev/uat/prod) include API client dependencies
3. **Simplified Maintenance**: One less requirements file to manage and update
4. **Better CI/CD Integration**: Build system handles all dependencies consistently
5. **Reduced Confusion**: Clear hierarchy with base → environment-specific requirements

## 📊 **Impact on Components:**

### **API Clients (`scripts/clients/`):**
- ✅ All dependencies now available in any environment
- ✅ No separate installation step required
- ✅ Integrated with main application dependency management

### **Build System:**
- ✅ Handles all dependencies through existing requirements structure
- ✅ Environment-specific optimizations maintained
- ✅ Consistent dependency resolution across environments

### **Deployment:**
- ✅ Single requirements installation per environment
- ✅ No additional dependency management complexity
- ✅ Standard Python packaging practices followed

## 🎯 **Result:**

The project now has a clean, unified dependency management system where:
- **Base requirements** include core dependencies needed by all components
- **Environment-specific requirements** extend base with specialized tools
- **API clients** integrate seamlessly with the main application
- **No duplicate or separate requirement files** to maintain

This consolidation improves maintainability and follows Python packaging best practices.
