# IAM Security Diagrams Documentation

## Overview

This document accompanies the visual IAM security diagrams created to illustrate the complete security model and access control patterns for the mono-repo infrastructure.

## Generated Diagrams

### 1. IAM Roles & Policies Matrix (`iam_roles_policies_matrix`)
**Purpose**: Complete security access control model showing relationships between users, roles, and policies

**Key Components**:
- **User Groups**: Super Admins, Security Team, DevOps Team, Developers, Business Users, Service Accounts
- **IAM Roles**: Environment-specific roles with appropriate privilege levels
- **Policy Attachments**: Direct policy assignments and managed policy usage
- **MFA Requirements**: Multi-factor authentication enforcement
- **IP Restrictions**: Corporate network access controls

**Security Features**:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Separation of duties
- Administrative access controls

### 2. Permission Boundaries Flow (`permission_boundaries_flow`)
**Purpose**: Maximum permission enforcement model showing how boundaries limit effective permissions

**Flow Process**:
1. **Identity Policies**: Define intended permissions
2. **Permission Boundaries**: Set maximum allowed permissions
3. **Effective Permissions**: Intersection of identity and boundary policies
4. **Additional Conditions**: MFA, IP, time, and resource restrictions

**Boundary Types**:
- **Developer Boundary**: EKS, Lambda, S3, limited IAM
- **Operations Boundary**: Full infrastructure, limited IAM
- **Business Boundary**: Read-only access, no write operations
- **Security Boundary**: All security services, audit capabilities
- **Service Boundary**: Service-specific APIs, no user management

### 3. Security Groups Hierarchy (`security_groups_hierarchy`)
**Purpose**: Permission escalation and access levels across the organization

**Hierarchy Levels**:
- **Level 1**: Super Administrators (Full access)
- **Level 2**: Administrative Teams (Service administration)
- **Level 3**: Operations Teams (Infrastructure management)
- **Level 4**: Development & Business (Application development)
- **Level 5**: Service Accounts (Automated processes)

**Access Matrix**: Shows specific service permissions for each level

### 4. Cross-Account Access Patterns (`cross_account_access`)
**Purpose**: Service roles and trust relationships across AWS accounts

**Account Structure**:
- **Development Account**: Development resources and testing
- **UAT Account**: User acceptance testing environment
- **Production Account**: Production workloads
- **Shared Services Account**: Central logging and management
- **Security Account**: Security monitoring and compliance

**Trust Relationships**: Cross-account role assumptions with security controls

## Security Implementation

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Required for all administrative roles
- Console access requires MFA
- AssumeRole operations require MFA
- API access conditional on MFA

### IP Address Restrictions
- Corporate network access only
- VPN required for remote access
- Office IP range allowlists
- Emergency access IP controls

### Session Management
- Limited session duration
- Automatic session timeout
- Re-authentication requirements
- Session activity monitoring

### Monitoring and Auditing
- CloudTrail logging for all IAM actions
- AssumeRole event monitoring
- Regular access reviews
- Compliance reporting

## Usage Instructions

### Role Assignment Process
1. Identify user's job function and required access level
2. Assign appropriate group membership
3. Configure MFA requirements
4. Set up IP restrictions
5. Test access permissions
6. Document role assignment

### Permission Boundary Application
1. Determine user type (developer, operations, business, etc.)
2. Apply appropriate boundary policy
3. Validate effective permissions
4. Test boundary enforcement
5. Monitor for boundary violations

### Cross-Account Access Setup
1. Define trust relationship requirements
2. Create cross-account roles
3. Configure external ID requirements
4. Set up conditional access
5. Test cross-account functionality
6. Monitor cross-account activity

## Best Practices

### Security
- Always use principle of least privilege
- Implement defense in depth
- Regular security reviews
- Automated compliance checking
- Incident response procedures

### Operational
- Standardized role naming conventions
- Documented permission rationale
- Regular access audits
- Automated provisioning
- Change management processes

### Compliance
- SOC 2 compliance alignment
- Regular audit trail reviews
- Data access logging
- Privacy controls
- Regulatory requirement mapping
