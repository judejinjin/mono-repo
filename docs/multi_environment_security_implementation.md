# Multi-Environment Security Isolation Diagrams

*Generated on: 2025-09-25 14:06:03*

This document provides comprehensive analysis of the multi-environment security isolation diagrams for the Risk Management Platform infrastructure.

## Overview

The multi-environment security diagrams illustrate the comprehensive security architecture that ensures proper isolation and access control across Development, UAT/Staging, and Production environments. These diagrams demonstrate defense-in-depth security principles with multiple layers of protection.

## Generated Diagrams

### 1. Environment Isolation Architecture
**File**: `environment_isolation_architecture.png/.svg`

This diagram provides a high-level view of how DEV, UAT, and PROD environments are isolated within the AWS infrastructure.

**Key Components**:
- **Environment Boundaries**: Clear separation of DEV, UAT, and PROD environments
- **VPC Isolation**: Each environment operates in its own VPC with distinct CIDR blocks
- **Centralized Management**: Shared services for IAM, monitoring, and compliance
- **Cross-Environment Controls**: Strict policies governing inter-environment access

**Security Features**:
- Air-gapped production environment
- Controlled access between non-production environments  
- Centralized audit logging and monitoring
- Compliance with SOC 2, ISO 27001, and regulatory requirements

### 2. IAM Cross-Environment Access Patterns
**File**: `iam_cross_environment_access.png/.svg`

Detailed visualization of role-based access control (RBAC) and how different user groups can access resources across environments.

**Access Matrix**:
- **Developers**: Full DEV access, read-only UAT access, no PROD access
- **QA Testers**: Read-only DEV access, full UAT access, no PROD access  
- **DevOps Engineers**: Deployment access to all environments via automation
- **Platform Admins**: Administrative access with break-glass for PROD

**Key Security Controls**:
- Principle of least privilege enforcement
- Multi-factor authentication requirements
- Time-based and IP-based access restrictions
- Comprehensive audit logging via CloudTrail

### 3. Network Segmentation & Security Groups
**File**: `network_segmentation_security.png/.svg`

Comprehensive network architecture showing how traffic is controlled and isolated between environments and within each environment.

**Network Architecture**:
- **VPC Segmentation**: Separate VPCs for each environment (10.0.0.0/16, 10.1.0.0/16, 10.2.0.0/16)
- **Subnet Strategy**: Public, private application, private database, and management subnets
- **Security Group Rules**: Layer-4 traffic control with specific port and protocol restrictions
- **Network ACLs**: Additional layer-3/4 controls for defense-in-depth

**Traffic Flow Patterns**:
1. **User Requests**: Internet → ALB → Application → Database
2. **Management Access**: Corporate VPN → Bastion → Private Resources
3. **Monitoring**: Resources → CloudWatch → Management VPC
4. **Deployment**: CI/CD Pipeline → Target Environment → Validation

### 4. Resource Tagging & Policy Enforcement
**File**: `resource_tagging_governance.png/.svg`

Governance framework using resource tags for access control, cost management, and compliance enforcement.

**Mandatory Tag Schema**:
- **Environment**: dev | uat | prod (environment isolation)
- **Project**: risk-management (resource grouping)
- **Owner**: team-name@company.com (responsibility tracking)
- **CostCenter**: CC-XXXX (billing allocation)
- **DataClassification**: public | internal | confidential (data governance)
- **Backup**: required | optional | none (backup policies)

**Tag-Based Access Control (TBAC)**:
- IAM policies that use tag conditions for resource access
- Environment-specific access based on tag values
- Data classification controls for sensitive information
- Cost center-based resource management

## Security Architecture Principles

### Defense in Depth
Multiple security layers provide comprehensive protection:

1. **Network Layer**: VPCs, subnets, security groups, NACLs
2. **Identity Layer**: IAM roles, policies, MFA, temporary credentials
3. **Application Layer**: Resource tagging, encryption, monitoring
4. **Data Layer**: Backup policies, data classification, access logging
5. **Management Layer**: Centralized governance, compliance validation

### Zero Trust Architecture
- No implicit trust between environments or services
- Every access request is authenticated and authorized
- Continuous monitoring and validation of access patterns
- Automated response to suspicious activities

### Compliance Framework
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security, availability, and confidentiality controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Financial services and data protection requirements
- **Industry Standards**: AWS Well-Architected Framework security pillar

## Operational Procedures

### Access Management
1. **User Provisioning**: Role-based access assignment with environment restrictions
2. **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly access audits and cleanup procedures  
3. **Break-Glass Access**: Emergency procedures for critical production issues
4. **Automated Remediation**: Policy violations automatically blocked and reported

### Monitoring and Alerting
1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics and logs for all environments
2. **Security Alerts**: Automated notifications for policy violations
3. **Cost Monitoring**: Tag-based cost allocation and budget alerts
4. **Compliance Dashboards**: Daily reports on governance and security posture

### Incident Response
1. **Automated Detection**: Security events trigger immediate response workflows
2. **Isolation Procedures**: Compromised resources can be quickly quarantined
3. **Forensic Capabilities**: Complete audit trail for security investigations
4. **Recovery Processes**: Environment-specific backup and restoration procedures

## Implementation Guidelines

### Environment Setup
1. Deploy VPCs with appropriate CIDR blocks for each environment
2. Configure security groups following principle of least privilege
3. Implement mandatory tagging policies through AWS Config
4. Set up centralized logging and monitoring infrastructure

### Access Control Implementation
1. Create environment-specific IAM roles and policies
2. Configure cross-environment access restrictions
3. Implement MFA requirements for sensitive operations
4. Set up break-glass procedures for emergency access

### Monitoring Configuration
1. Enable CloudTrail for all API activity logging
2. Configure CloudWatch alarms for security events
3. Set up cost allocation tags and budget monitoring
4. Implement compliance validation rules

## Security Validation

### Regular Security Assessments
- Monthly vulnerability scans across all environments
- Quarterly penetration testing of production systems
- Annual security architecture reviews and updates
- Continuous compliance monitoring and reporting

### Automated Security Testing
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning
- Container and application security assessments
- Network segmentation validation testing
- Access control verification procedures

### Compliance Auditing
- Automated compliance checks against security baselines
- Regular audit log reviews and analysis
- Tag compliance monitoring and remediation
- Cost allocation accuracy verification

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Review Cycle
1. **Monthly**: Security group rules and access patterns
2. **Quarterly**: IAM policies and role assignments
3. **Semi-Annual**: Network architecture and segmentation
4. **Annual**: Complete security architecture review

### Change Management
- All security changes must be approved through formal change control
- Infrastructure changes deployed through automated pipelines
- Security policy updates require security team approval
- Emergency changes follow documented break-glass procedures
