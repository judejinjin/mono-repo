This diagram shows the complete S3 bucket structure and organization strategy across environments.

**Bucket Organization Strategy**:
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate bucket sets for DEV, UAT, and PROD environments
- **Functional Separation**: Distinct buckets for applications, static assets, logs, backups, documents, and ML models
- **Shared Services**: Centralized buckets for cross-environment services like CloudTrail, Config, and disaster recovery
- **Naming Convention**: Consistent `rm-{environment}-{service}-{purpose}` pattern

**Storage Classes & Lifecycle**:
- **Standard**: Active data with frequent access (< 30 days)
- **Standard-IA**: Infrequent access and backup data (30-90 days)
- **Glacier Flexible**: Archive and compliance data (90 days - 1 year)
- **Glacier Deep Archive**: Long-term retention (> 1 year)

### 2. IAM & Bucket Policy Access Control

**Access Control Matrix**:
- **Developer Role**: Full DEV access, read-only UAT, no PROD access
- **QA Tester Role**: Read-only DEV, full UAT access, no PROD access
- **DevOps Role**: Deployment access to all environments via automation
- **Application Service Role**: Read/write access to application-specific buckets
- **Analytics Role**: Data lake access with read permissions to production analytics

**Policy Types**:
1. **Environment Isolation**: Cross-environment access restrictions with MFA requirements
2. **Application-Specific**: Service-based permissions for different application components
3. **Data Classification**: Access controls based on public, internal, and confidential data
4. **Conditional Access**: Time-based, IP-restricted, and MFA-required access patterns

### 3. Data Lifecycle & Cross-Account Access
**File**: `data_lifecycle_cross_account.png/.svg`

Automated data lifecycle management and cross-account sharing patterns for partner integration.

**Lifecycle Management**:
- **Development**: Aggressive 30-day retention with auto-cleanup
- **UAT/Staging**: Moderate 90-day lifecycle with archival policies
- **Production**: 7-year compliance retention with full lifecycle automation

**Cross-Account Patterns**:
- **Partner Data Exchange**: Secure external partner access via assumed roles
- **Vendor Analytics**: Time-limited access tokens for third-party analytics
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region and cross-account replication strategies
- **Audit & Compliance**: Dedicated audit account access for compliance reviews

**Replication Strategy**:
- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**: Production data replicated to DR region
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR)**: Critical data replicated to different storage classes
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Versioned storage for application data recovery
- **Cross-Account Backup**: Compliance data backed up to dedicated backup accounts

### 4. S3 Security & Compliance Framework
**File**: `s3_security_compliance.png/.svg`

Complete security and compliance framework covering encryption, monitoring, and governance.

**Encryption Framework**:
- **Data at Rest**: S3-KMS encryption with environment-specific keys
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 encryption for all data transfers
- **Client-Side**: Application-managed encryption for sensitive workloads
- **Cross-Region**: KMS key replication for disaster recovery scenarios

**Monitoring & Alerting**:
- **CloudTrail**: API call logging and access pattern analysis
- **CloudWatch**: Performance metrics and threshold-based alerting
- **GuardDuty**: Threat detection and anomaly identification
- **Macie**: PII discovery and data classification automation

**Security Controls Matrix**:
1. **Access Control**: IAM policies, bucket policies, ACLs, and MFA requirements
2. **Data Protection**: Encryption, versioning, and cross-region replication
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and threat detection
4. **Governance**: Lifecycle policies, cost controls, tagging, and access reviews

## Security Architecture Implementation

### Multi-Layered Security Approach
The S3 security architecture implements defense-in-depth principles:

1. **Network Layer**: VPC endpoints and network-based access restrictions
2. **Identity Layer**: IAM policies with role-based access control
3. **Resource Layer**: Bucket policies with fine-grained permissions
4. **Object Layer**: ACLs and object-level security controls
5. **Data Layer**: Encryption at rest and in transit
6. **Monitoring Layer**: Comprehensive logging and threat detection

### Access Control Hierarchy
Security controls are evaluated in the following order:
1. **IAM Policies**: Account-level user and role permissions (highest priority)
2. **Bucket Policies**: Resource-based bucket-level permissions
3. **ACLs**: Legacy object-level permissions (lowest priority)
4. **VPC Endpoints**: Network-based access overlay controls

### Data Classification Framework
All S3 data is classified according to sensitivity levels:

- **Public**: Publicly accessible data with authentication requirements
- **Internal**: Company-internal data with role-based access controls
- **Confidential**: Sensitive data requiring encryption and restricted access
- **PII**: Personally identifiable information with additional logging and monitoring
