# Developer Roles & Privileges Summary

**Generated:** September 21, 2025  
**Infrastructure:** AWS IAM with Terraform Management  
**Question:** "Can you summarize whether developer roles will be created and what privileges developer roles will have?"

---

## 🎯 **ANSWER: YES - Streamlined Developer Role System Implemented**

Your infrastructure **WILL CREATE** a simplified, two-tier developer role system that provides full development capabilities to all developers while maintaining leadership privileges for team leads. Here's the complete breakdown:

---

## 👥 **Developer User Creation & Management**

### **✅ Individual Developer Accounts**
```hcl
# Each developer gets their own AWS user account
resource "aws_iam_user" "developers" {
  name = "${local.name_prefix}-dev-${each.value.name}"  # e.g., "mono-repo-dev-dev-john"
  path = "/developers/"
}
```

### **🔧 Developer User Features:**
- ✅ **Console Access** with forced password reset on first login
- ✅ **Programmatic Access** with access keys automatically stored in Secrets Manager
- ✅ **MFA Support** - Virtual MFA devices created when enabled
- ✅ **Team-based Organization** - Users categorized by: junior, senior, lead, architect, intern
- ✅ **Email & Team Tracking** - Full metadata for user management

### **📋 Developer User Configuration:**
```hcl
variable "developer_users" {
  type = list(object({
    name  = string    # Developer's name/username
    email = string    # Contact email
    team  = string    # junior|senior|lead|architect|intern
  }))
}
```

---

## 🎭 **Two-Tier Developer Role System**

### **1. � Developer Role** (Unified for all developers)
**Who can assume:** Users with team = "junior", "senior", or "intern"  
**Session Duration:** Full configured session duration  
**MFA Required:** Configurable  
**IP Restrictions:** Office networks  

#### **Developer Permissions:**
```json
✅ ALLOWED:
- eks:* (Full EKS cluster access)
- eks:UpdateNodegroup* (Node group management)
- s3:* (Full access to approved buckets)
- lambda:* (Full Lambda function management)
- secretsmanager:GetSecretValue (Non-admin secrets only)
- rds:DescribeDB*, rds:CreateDBSnapshot
- cloudwatch:*, logs:* (Full monitoring)

❌ EXPLICITLY DENIED:
- iam:CreateRole, iam:DeleteRole
- iam:CreateUser, iam:DeleteUser
- iam:*Policy* (No policy management)
```

### **2. 🔴 Team Lead Role**
**Who can assume:** Users with team = "lead" or "architect"  
**Session Duration:** Full configured session duration  
**MFA Required:** ALWAYS (hardcoded true)  
**IP Restrictions:** Office networks  

#### **Team Lead Permissions:**
```json
✅ ALLOWED:
- AWS PowerUserAccess (Full AWS access except IAM user/role management)
- Advanced infrastructure management
- Resource creation and management capabilities
```

---

## 🛡️ **Permission Boundaries - SECURITY GUARDRAILS**

**ALL developer roles are subject to a comprehensive permission boundary:**

### **✅ Maximum Allowed Services:**
- EKS (Kubernetes management)
- Lambda (Function management)
- S3 (Object storage)
- CloudWatch & Logs (Monitoring)
- Secrets Manager (Application secrets)
- ECR (Container registry)
- Limited RDS (Database read operations)
- API Gateway (API management)

### **🌍 Geographic Restrictions:**
- Operations limited to deployment region only
- Cannot operate in other AWS regions

### **❌ Hard Security Blocks:**
```json
PERMANENTLY DENIED (Cannot be overridden):
- iam:CreateRole, iam:DeleteRole (No role management)
- iam:CreateUser, iam:DeleteUser (No user management) 
- iam:*Policy (No policy management)
- ec2:TerminateInstances (No instance termination)
- eks:DeleteCluster (No cluster deletion)
- rds:DeleteDB* (No database deletion)
- s3:DeleteBucket (No bucket deletion)
- billing:*, budgets:* (No billing access)
```

---

## 👥 **Developer Groups & Base Permissions**

### **🏛️ Main Developer Group**
**All developers automatically get:**
- ✅ **Self-service IAM:** Change own password, manage MFA, manage access keys
- ✅ **AWS information:** View roles, policies, account info (read-only)
- ✅ **Developer secrets:** Access secrets tagged for developers
- ✅ **Basic EKS info:** Describe clusters and components

### **📊 Specialized Subgroups:**

#### **Developer Subgroup:**
- Full development capabilities for all team members
- Extended S3 access to project buckets
- Lambda function management capabilities
- Database snapshot creation rights
- EKS cluster management permissions

---

## 🔐 **Security Features**

### **🛡️ Multi-Factor Authentication:**
- Virtual MFA devices created for each developer
- MFA requirement configurable per role
- Team leads ALWAYS require MFA

### **🌐 Network Security:**
- All developer access restricted to office IP ranges
- No remote access without VPN/corporate network
- IP address validation on every role assumption

### **⏰ Session Management:**
- All developers: Configurable session duration
- Team leads: Configurable session duration
- Token freshness validation (5-minute maximum age)

### **🔍 Audit & Monitoring:**
- All developer actions logged via CloudTrail
- Access key usage tracked and monitored
- Secret access logged and encrypted

---

## 📝 **Implementation Details**

### **🚀 How Developers Will Use These Roles:**

#### **Step 1: Login**
Developer logs into AWS Console with their individual account (`mono-repo-dev-john`)

#### **Step 2: Assume Role**
Based on their team assignment, they can assume the appropriate role:
- All Developers (junior/senior/intern) → `mono-repo-developer-role`
- Team Leads (lead/architect) → `mono-repo-team-lead-role`

#### **Step 3: Work Within Boundaries**
All actions are constrained by the permission boundary, ensuring they cannot exceed their maximum allowed permissions.

### **🔧 Access Key Management:**
```json
{
  "access_key_id": "AKIA...",
  "secret_access_key": "...",
  "user_name": "mono-repo-dev-john",
  "email": "john@company.com",
  "team": "senior"
}
```
*Automatically stored encrypted in AWS Secrets Manager*

## 🎯 **Summary Answer**

### **✅ WILL DEVELOPER ROLES BE CREATED?**
**YES** - A streamlined 2-tier developer role system will be created:
1. **Developer Role** (unified permissions for all developers)
2. **Team Lead Role** (PowerUser access for leads/architects)

### **🔐 WHAT PRIVILEGES WILL THEY HAVE?**

| Role Level | EKS Access | S3 Access | Lambda | RDS | IAM | Session |
|------------|------------|-----------|---------|-----|-----|---------|
| **Developer** | Full management | Project buckets | Full management | Read + Snapshots | Self-only | Configurable |
| **Team Lead** | PowerUser | All approved | PowerUser | PowerUser | Self-only | Configurable |

### **🛡️ SECURITY GUARDRAILS:**
- **Permission boundaries** prevent privilege escalation
- **IP restrictions** to office networks only
- **MFA enforcement** for sensitive operations
- **Audit logging** for all actions
- **Hard denies** on destructive operations

### **💡 BUSINESS VALUE:**
- **Secure development** with appropriate access levels
- **Principle of least privilege** enforced automatically
- **Self-service capabilities** for developer productivity
- **Audit compliance** with full access tracking
- **Team-based permissions** matching organizational structure

**The infrastructure provides enterprise-grade developer access management with security built-in from day one.** 🚀
