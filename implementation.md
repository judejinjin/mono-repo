# Mono-Repo Infrastructure Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for a comprehensive mono-repo infrastructure using Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes, and various development tools.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Infrastructure Layer (AWS + Terraform)
- **VPC with public/private subnets**
- **EKS cluster for Kubernetes workloads**
- **On-premise Linux server for development (existing corporate infrastructure)**
- **RDS instances for databases**
- **S3 buckets for storage**
- **IAM roles and policies**
- **Security groups and NACLs**

### 2. Development Environment
- **On-Premise Dev Server (Corporate Linux)**
  - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  - Python 3.11+ with virtual environments
  - Node.js 18+ with global packages
  - Git, Docker, kubectl, terraform
  - SSH access for developers
- **VS Code Remote SSH configuration**

### 3. Kubernetes Cluster (EKS)
- **Bamboo CI/CD server**
- **Apache Airflow (self-managed)**
- **Application services (FastAPI, web apps)**
- **Monitoring and logging**

### 4. Mono-Repo Structure

```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1-2)
1. **Terraform Infrastructure**
   - VPC and networking
   - EKS cluster
   - On-premise Linux development server setup
   - RDS databases
   - S3 buckets
   - Security configurations

2. **On-Premise Development Server Setup**
   - Configure existing Linux server with Python 3.11, Node.js
   - Set up virtual environments and development tools
   - Install required packages and dependencies
   - Configure SSH access for developers via VS Code Remote SSH

### Phase 2: Kubernetes Setup (Week 2-3)
1. **EKS Configuration**
   - Node groups setup
   - RBAC configuration
   - Ingress controller
   - Cert-manager for SSL

2. **Core Services Deployment**
   - Bamboo CI/CD server
   - Apache Airflow
   - Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)

### Phase 3: Mono-Repo Structure (Week 3-4)
1. **Repository Structure**
   - Create directory structure
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Configure branch protection rules

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment-specific configs
   - Secrets management
   - Database connection management

### Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline (Week 4-5)
1. **Bamboo Configuration**
   - Build plans for different components
   - Deployment plans
   - Environment promotion

2. **Airflow Setup**
   - DAG deployment pipeline
   - Worker configuration
   - Scheduler setup

### Phase 5: Application Deployment (Week 5-6)
1. **Service Deployment**
   - FastAPI services
   - Web applications
   - Dash applications

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance testing
   - Security validation

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Environment Management
- **Environment Variable Strategy**: Use ENV environment variable to determine current environment
- **Configuration Hierarchy**: environment-specific overrides
- **Secret Management**: AWS Secrets Manager integration

### 2. Database Abstraction
- **Connection Pooling**: Per-environment connection pools
- **Query Abstraction**: ORM-based with raw SQL support
- **Migration Management**: Alembic for schema changes

### 3. Cloud Abstraction
- **Service Abstraction**: Unified interface for AWS services
- **Credential Management**: IAM roles and service accounts
- **Resource Discovery**: Dynamic resource discovery based on environment

### 4. Development Workflow
- **Feature Branch Workflow**: Developers work on feature branches
- **Pull Request Process**: Code review and automated testing
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automatic deployment to dev environment

## Security Considerations

### 1. Network Security
- Private subnets for sensitive services
- Security groups with least privilege
- VPN/bastion host for external access

### 2. Access Control
- IAM roles with minimal permissions
- RBAC in Kubernetes
- SSH key management

### 3. Secrets Management
- AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- Kubernetes secrets for application secrets
- No hardcoded credentials in code

## Monitoring and Logging

### 1. Application Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- Custom application metrics

### 2. Infrastructure Monitoring
- CloudWatch for AWS resources
- Kubernetes metrics
- Log aggregation with ELK stack

### 3. Alerting
- Critical system alerts
- Application performance alerts
- Security incident alerts

## Disaster Recovery

### 1. Backup Strategy
- Database backups
- Code repository backups
- Configuration backups

### 2. Recovery Procedures
- Infrastructure recreation with Terraform
- Data restoration procedures
- Service recovery priorities

## Cost Optimization

### 1. Resource Management
- Auto-scaling for Kubernetes workloads
- Scheduled scaling for development resources
- Spot instances where appropriate

### 2. Monitoring
- Cost tracking and alerting
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Regular cost reviews

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve implementation plan
2. Set up AWS account and initial Terraform state
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Establish development team access
5. Create initial mono-repo structure
6. Implement core configuration and library modules
7. Set up CI/CD pipelines
8. Deploy initial applications
9. Testing and validation
10. Production readiness assessment
